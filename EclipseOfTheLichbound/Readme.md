# Eclipse of the Lichbound

## Synopsis

In **"Eclipse of the Lichbound,"** a valiant party of adventurers awakens to find themselves ensnared within the dark dreams orchestrated by Valthorak the Eternal, a formidable lich who has mastered the art of manipulating nightmares. Valthorak seeks to trap the souls of the living to bolster his unholy immortality, and only by overcoming his sinister trials can the heroes hope to escape his clutches.

## Adventure Structure

### 1. The Four Nightmares

- **Encounter Challenges:** The adventurers must navigate through four distinct nightmares, each uniquely crafted by Valthorak. These nightmares are populated with pre-generated undead and other nightmarish creatures, each governed by specific "Attack Protocols" that dictate their strategies and behaviors.

- **Resource Management:** Within each nightmare, players can explore to upgrade their equipment by tapping into the dark energies of the dreamscape. However, these enhancements come with inherent risks, such as attracting more formidable foes or triggering environmental hazards.

- **Loot and Rewards:** After overcoming the challenges of each nightmare, players will roll on Loot Tables to acquire powerful artifacts and resources that can aid them in their quest. Strategic use of these items can turn the tide in subsequent encounters.

- **Scoring System:** Points are awarded based on the party's efficiency—clearing rooms without any member dropping below 0 HP and completing challenges swiftly earn higher scores, encouraging both careful planning and decisive action.

### 2. Escape the Lich's Labyrinth

- **Skill Challenge:** Having survived the four nightmares, the adventurers must now navigate the intricate and ever-shifting corridors of Valthorak's Labyrinth. This is a theater-of-the-mind skill challenge where players can creatively utilize any of their skills to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and evade traps set by the lich.

- **Outcome:** Success in this challenge allows the party to confront Valthorak directly in the final battle. Failure, however, results in their souls being eternally bound within the labyrinth, lost to the lich's dark realm.

### 3. Final Confrontation with Valthorak the Eternal

- **Epic Battle:** The showdown with Valthorak is designed to be a monumental challenge. The lich employs a variety of devastating spells, legendary resistances, and cunning tactics to thwart the adventurers. While victory is difficult to achieve, it is not impossible for those who have effectively prepared and utilized their resources.

- **Scoring Metrics:** Points are also awarded based on the complexity and potency of Valthorak's actions—each spell he casts, each legendary resistance he employs, and the total damage inflicted by the adventurers contribute to the overall score, adding depth to the final encounter.

## Game Mechanics

- **Board Game Elements:** **"Eclipse of the Lichbound"** is designed to function more like a board game than a traditional D&D session. Without a Dungeon Master to adjudicate on-the-fly decisions (e.g., "Can I climb on the dragon's back?"), all actions and outcomes are governed by the predefined rules and mechanics, ensuring a streamlined and balanced gameplay experience.

# Rules for Eclipse of the Lichbound

## General Recommendations

These rules are designed to enhance the gameplay experience in **Eclipse of the Lichbound**. Keep in mind that altering these rules may lead to inconsistent results, especially if you’re aiming for optimal builds or teams. If consistency is important, try to settle on a ruleset for your table and stick with it.

## Nightmare Sequence

When entering a new nightmare, follow these steps in order:

1. **Read the Description:**  
   Any player can read the nightmare’s description, which includes narrative background, special rules, and monster protocols.

2. **Roll Initiative:**  
   Set turn orders for characters and monsters. Monsters of the same type act on the same initiative, starting with those closest to the players. If there’s uncertainty about which monster goes first, resolve it with a random dice roll.

3. **Combat:**  
   Players use their resources—spells, abilities, weapons, etc.—to defeat the monsters.

4. **Loot:**  
   After the last monster falls, immediately roll for loot. Players can then use any gained loot during the remainder of the nightmare. At the end of combat in each room, each player rolls a d6 and consults Loot Table A or B. The chance to roll on Loot Table B increases as they progress through the rooms, as shown in the table below:

   | Nightmare Completed | D6 Result to Roll on Table B |
   | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | Nightmare 1         | 6                            |
   | Nightmare 2         | 5-6                          |
   | Nightmare 3         | 4-6                          |
   | Nightmare 4         | 3-6                          |

5. **Interact with the Scene:**  
   Some rooms allow characters to interact with their environment for potential buffs. However, failing these checks can result in damage, so consider healing before attempting risky actions.

6. **Roll for the Next Nightmare:**  
   Roll a d20 or use a custom deck of shuffled cards to randomly determine the next nightmare.

## Progression Through Nightmares

- **Nightmare Difficulty:**  
  Each nightmare becomes progressively more difficult. For each subsequent nightmare:

  - **Second Nightmare:**  
    Enemies gain +1 on attack rolls, armor class, and spell save DCs, and deal an extra 1d6 (or 4) damage with their attacks.
  
  - **Third Nightmare:**  
    Enemies score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, gain +2 on attack rolls, armor class, and spell save DCs, and deal an extra 2d6 (or 8) damage with their attacks.
  
  - **Fourth Nightmare:**  
    Enemies score critical hits on a roll of 18, 19, or 20, gain +3 on attack rolls, armor class, and spell save DCs, and deal an extra 3d6 (or 12) damage with their attacks.

## Escape Sequence

If the players successfully complete the fourth nightmare, they enter a magical labyrinth with Valthorak in spectral form chasing them. Follow these steps:

1. **Initial Skill Test:**  
   The DM (or lead player) rolls a +5 Athletics check for Valthorak to set the DC for the first skill test. Each character attempts to beat this result using a skill of their choice. Success earns one group success; failure earns one group failure. Once a character has used a skill, they cannot use another skill until the rest of the characters have taken their turn.

2. **Skill Challenge:**  
   Continue this process until the group achieves either 6 successes or 3 failures.

3. **Consequences of Failure:**  
   If a character fails, they suffer 3d6 slashing damage and 3d6 psychic damage from Valthorak's spectral blade.

4. **Repeating Skills:**  
   If a character uses a skill that another character has already used, increase the DC of Valthorak’s check by 3 for each additional repetition.

5. **Critical Rolls:**  
   A natural 1 counts as 2 failures, unless the total still beats the Mad King’s Athletics result. A natural 20 counts as 2 successes, unless the total is still lower than Valthorak’s Athletics result.

6. **Outcome:**  
   If the group passes the skill challenge, they reach a portal that transports them to Valthorak’s throne room. If they fail, they are trapped in the labyrinth forever.

## Additional Gameplay House Rules

- **Flanking:**  
  This module uses the optional rules for flanking as presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, with a minor tweak. When two creatures attack an enemy from opposite sides with melee weapons, that creature is flanked. Any melee attack targeting a flanked creature is made with advantage.

- **Potions as a Bonus Action:**  
  Potions can be consumed as a bonus action, with no penalties for having multiple types of potions in your system at once.

## Character Creation House Rules

- **Stat Array:**  
  Players can create characters using the following stat array: 17, 15, 14, 12, 10, 8. Any combination of race and class is allowed from the official D&D 5e ruleset, including new modules released by WotC. Homebrew races and subclasses require DM approval.

- **Starting Equipment and Pre-Casting Spells:**
  - **Armor:**  
    Characters proficient in heavy armor start with Splint mail; those proficient in medium armor start with a Breastplate; those proficient in light armor start with Studded leather.
  
  - **Weapons and Armor:**  
    Characters can start with any reasonable non-magical weapons and armor (firearms optional).
  
  - **Spell Components:**  
    Spellcasters can start with up to 200gp worth of material components for spells that require them, or choose components for one spell to use once.
  
  - **Pre-Casting:**  
    If a character has a spell (e.g., Find Familiar) that lasts an hour or more and would reasonably have been cast before the nightmare, it can be cast without consuming a spell slot. This also applies to class features like the Artificer’s Eldritch Cannon. Spells designed specifically for combat, like Protection from Evil and Good, cannot be pre-cast.
  
  - **Preparation Between Rooms:**  
    Once characters have cleared a room, they can use the remaining minute to cast any spells they wish before the next nightmare, but they cannot do so after seeing what the next nightmare entails.

## Assassin Rogue House Rule

- **Assassinate Ability:**  
  The following is added to the Assassin Rogue's "Assassinate" ability: If the target has not taken its turn yet this round, in addition to making your attack with advantage, you score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20.
