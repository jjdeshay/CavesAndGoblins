# Eclipse of the Lichbound

## Synopsis

In **"Eclipse of the Lichbound,"** a valiant party of adventurers awakens to find themselves ensnared within the dark dreams orchestrated by Valthorak the Eternal, a formidable lich who has mastered the art of manipulating nightmares. Valthorak seeks to trap the souls of the living to bolster his unholy immortality, and only by overcoming his sinister trials can the heroes hope to escape his clutches.

## Adventure Structure

### 1. The Four Nightmares

- **Encounter Challenges:** The adventurers must navigate through four distinct nightmares, each uniquely crafted by Valthorak. These nightmares are populated with pre-generated undead and other nightmarish creatures, each governed by specific "Attack Protocols" that dictate their strategies and behaviors.

- **Resource Management:** Within each nightmare, players can explore to upgrade their equipment by tapping into the dark energies of the dreamscape. However, these enhancements come with inherent risks, such as attracting more formidable foes or triggering environmental hazards.

- **Loot and Rewards:** After overcoming the challenges of each nightmare, players will roll on Loot Tables to acquire powerful artifacts and resources that can aid them in their quest. Strategic use of these items can turn the tide in subsequent encounters.

- **Scoring System:** Points are awarded based on the party's efficiency—clearing rooms without any member dropping below 0 HP and completing challenges swiftly earn higher scores, encouraging both careful planning and decisive action.

### 2. Escape the Lich's Labyrinth

- **Skill Challenge:** Having survived the four nightmares, the adventurers must now navigate the intricate and ever-shifting corridors of Valthorak's Labyrinth. This is a theater-of-the-mind skill challenge where players can creatively utilize any of their skills to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and evade traps set by the lich.

- **Outcome:** Success in this challenge allows the party to confront Valthorak directly in the final battle. Failure, however, results in their souls being eternally bound within the labyrinth, lost to the lich's dark realm.

### 3. Final Confrontation with Valthorak the Eternal

- **Epic Battle:** The showdown with Valthorak is designed to be a monumental challenge. The lich employs a variety of devastating spells, legendary resistances, and cunning tactics to thwart the adventurers. While victory is difficult to achieve, it is not impossible for those who have effectively prepared and utilized their resources.

- **Scoring Metrics:** Points are also awarded based on the complexity and potency of Valthorak's actions—each spell he casts, each legendary resistance he employs, and the total damage inflicted by the adventurers contribute to the overall score, adding depth to the final encounter.

## Game Mechanics

- **Board Game Elements:** **"Eclipse of the Lichbound"** is designed to function more like a board game than a traditional D&D session. Without a Dungeon Master to adjudicate on-the-fly decisions (e.g., "Can I climb on the dragon's back?"), all actions and outcomes are governed by the predefined rules and mechanics, ensuring a streamlined and balanced gameplay experience.
